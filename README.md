## Overview
Amplify is a web application that automatically generates a Spotify playlist for the user from the songs played at a band or artist's concert.

The app allows a user to search for a concert by an artist or band's name, and for each concert matching the user's search query, it displays the name of the band/artist, the name of the venue, the location (city, state, and country), and the date of the concert. Once the user finds the concert from which they would like to generate a playlist, they simply select "Create Playlist" to generate a Spotify playlist containing the songs performed at that concert.
